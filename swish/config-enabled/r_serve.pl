/** <module> Provide R access using Rserve

This config file provides access   to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) by
means                               of                               the
[Rserve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rserve/index.html)
package.

To use this config file, you need to

  1. Install the Rserve client Prolog pack from Prolog:

     ```
     $ git submodule update pack/rserve_client
     $ swipl run.pl
     ?- pack_rebuild(rserve_client).
     ```

  2. Install R in an OS sandbox.  We provided a Docker recipe for that
     at https://github.com/JanWielemaker/rserve-sandbox.  This docker
     image makes Rserve accessible at `/home/rserve/socket`, which is
     accessible for users in the group `rserve`

  3. Add the user running SWISH to the group `rserve` to provide access
     to the Rserve socket.

% EDIT: Uncomment and edit these values if Rserve is accessible
% from another location.  If a `socket` is configured and exists
% the socket is used.  Otherwise it will try a TCP connection to
% the given host and port.
%
% IF R IS NOT RUNNING IN AN OS SANDBOX, COMMENT THE SANDBOX LINE
% ABOVE AND RUN SWISH WITH AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT.

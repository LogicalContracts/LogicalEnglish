<p>The parser of LE assumes a document with the following structure. One declaration title like:</p>

    the templates are:

<p>followed by the declarations of all the corresponding predicates mentioned in the knowledge base.</p>

<p>Each declarations define a template with the variables and other words required to describe a relevant relation. 
  It is a comma separated list of templates which ends
  with a period.</p>

<p>After that period, one of the following statement introduces the knowledge base:</p>

    the knowledge base includes:

<p>or</p>

    the knowledge base [name of the kb] includes:

<p>And it is followed by the rules and facts written in Logical English syntax.</p>

<p>Each rule must end with a period.</p>

<p>Indentation is used to organize the and/or list of conditions by strict observance 
of one condition per line with a level of indentation that corresponds to each operator and corresponding conditions.</p>

<p>Similarly, there may be sections for scenarios and queries, like:</p>

    scenario test is:
        borrower pays an amount to lender on 2015-06-01.

<p>and</p>

    query one is:
      for which event:
          the small business restructure rollover applies to the event.

    query two is:
      which tax payer is a party of which event.

    query three is:
        A first time is after a second time
        and the second time is immediately before the first time.

<p>which can then be used on the new command interface of LE on SWISH (e.g. answer/1 and others querying predicates)</p>

      ? answer 'query one with scenario test'.

<p>A first example is shown below, as part of this notebook. It could be used a separated program as well</p>

the templates are:

*a person* is born in *a place* on *a date*,
*a date* is after commencement,

*a person* is the father of *a person*,
*a person* is a British citizen on *a date*,
*a person* is settled in the UK on *a date*,
*a person* says that *a sentence*,

the knowledge base citizenship includes:
a person acquires British citizenship on a date

scenario alice is:
John is born in the UK on 2021-10-09.
2021-10-09 is after commencement.
Alice is the mother of John.
Alice is a British citizen on 2021-10-09.
        
query one is:
    
which person acquires British citizenship on which date.

<div class="nb-cell markdown" name="md3">
This program can queried like this:
</div>

<div class="nb-cell query" name="one_with_alice">
answer one with alice. 
</div>

<div class="nb-cell markdown" name="md4">
But it can also be queried directly, like this:
</div>

<div class="nb-cell query" name="one_direct">
answer('which person acquires British citizenship on which date', with(alice)).
